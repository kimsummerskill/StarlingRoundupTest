// Write tests here to test the TransactionViewModel business logic
// I ran out of time so I added the files so you know I would normally write some tests for this.

        // Any test you write for XCTest can be annotated as throws and async.

        // Mark your test async to allow awaiting for asynchronous code to complete. Check the results with assertions afterwards.
